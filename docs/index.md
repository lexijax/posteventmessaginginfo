## Welcome to Post Event Messaging Info!

Post Event Messaging Info is a community-compiled resource for finding and sharing information about Post Event Messaging (PEM) in order to help organisations better understand, implement, and use PEM within their services.


### What is PEM?
[PEM](glossary.md#pem) stands for <b>P</b>ost <b>E</b>vent <b>M</b>essaging

Post Event Messaging ([PEM](glossary.md#pem)) in the context of NHS 111 is an electronic document, that is transmitted to GP practices at the end of an NHS 111 Call. There are essentially two types of [PEM](glossary.md#pem) a GP can receive, one that is ‘For Action’ meaning a GP has been referred back to their own GP with a timeframe associated with it. The other is a ‘For Information’ message, which is for the GP to inspect and file against the patients record.

As part of NHS 111 deployment it was clear that the technology Out of Hours services were using would not scale and cause significant problems. Two new methods were created to give options to areas using [CDA](glossary.md#cda) messages over [ITK](glossary.md#itk) or NHSMail. Practices not using these newer technologies are subjected to many of the identifed issues.
